# NodeJs-Express-HandsOn
In this project, I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, EJS, and Express with NodeJs to handle incoming requests, setup routes, in addition to store/read data and send back responses. 
In this project, I focused on applying some core concepts such as
- Express Router
- Dynamic routes, the key feature to show detail pages and to encode unique identification criteria in URL
- Building default error-handling middleware
- Building Util functions
